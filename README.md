# Cata

Cata is my first rice setup on Linux, built for Arch Linux.
The name is inspired by the beauty and delicacy of a TikTok content creator, whose aesthetic I wanted to reflect in my desktop environment.

This project aims not only to be functional and productive but also to convey a sense of beauty and harmony while working on the system.

## Acknowledgments

I want to give a special thanks to **ndrewA**, whose dotfiles served as a reference for structuring this project. Without that template, I probably wouldnâ€™t have known where to begin.
